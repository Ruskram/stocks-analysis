## Overview of Project

### Purpose

  The purpose of this project is to help Steve. Steve just graduated with a finance degree. His first clients are his parents who like green energy and put all their investments into DAQO which is a company that makes the silicon that is used in solar panels. Steve doesn't like that they have everything in one investment and would like for them to diversify their invesments. Steve gathered data on some other green energy companies and would like for us to do some analysis. He would like to know which companies would be good options for his parents to diversify their investments into.
